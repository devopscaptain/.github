# UCL Medical Imaging Research Software Group

> We aim to help the medical imaging community develop and maintain high quality
> software as well as providing solutions for storage and curation of data.

The medical imaging research software group (MIRSG) is a subgroup of the
Advanced Research Computing (ARC) Centre's Collaborations team, and is run as a
joint initiative with the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC).

The MIRSG aims to support the medical imaging research community by:

- Supporting software development for image analysis tools and their integration
  into wider platforms.
- Providing GDPR and Information Governance compliant storage for medical
  imaging data and associated data (see the UCL XNAT Service).
- Supporting and documenting tools and platforms which support medical imaging
  (e.g. high performance computing).
- Providing general infrastructure support where required, including
  streamlining transfer of imaging data from our partner hospitals.

Currently, weâ€™re working closely with partners in a variety of UCL/UCLH groups
and teams including the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), Centre for Medical Image
Computing, Centre for Medical Imaging, MRC LHA.
